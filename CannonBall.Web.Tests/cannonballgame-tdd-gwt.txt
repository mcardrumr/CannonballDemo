Cannonball Game TDD

GIVEN I have a game that presents a user with a target with x,y coordinates between 1 and 10
WHEN  I enter a valid angle between 1 and 90
AND   I enter a valid velocity between 1 and 20
THEN  I am told if I hit my target
AND   If I didn't hit the target I get to take another shot
AND   If I did hit the target I am told how many shots it took

Rounding degree calculator - round after division up to 10 number
Rounding X coord calculator - round

The math to figure out if an angle and velocity hit a target is to first determine the degrees from an angle (Angle * (Math.PI / 180)).
The X and Y coordinates of the shot are figured out by

Math.Cos(Degrees) * Velocity 

and Math.Sin(Degrees) * Velocity

--ANGLE VALIDATOR-- 15 mins

WHEN I enter 1 for velocity
THEN I get back true

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter 0 for velocity
THEN I get back false

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter 20 for velocity
THEN I get back true

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter 21 for velocity
THEN I get back false

--DEGREE Calculator -- 45 mins

THEN I get back 0.0174532925

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter 2
THEN I get back 0.034906585

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter 90
THEN I get back 1.570796325

--X Coord Calculator  - 10 

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter velocity 1
AND and a degree of 1
AND I compute my X coordinate
THEN I get back 1

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter velocity 2
AND A degree of 1
and I compute my X coordinate
THEN I get back 2

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter a velocity 20
AND A degree of 1
and I compute my X coordinate
THEN I get back 20

--Y Coord Calculator-- 10

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter velocity 1
AND and a degree of 1
AND I compute my Y coordinate
THEN I get back 0

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter velocity 2
AND A degree of 1
and I compute my Y coordinate
THEN I get back 0

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter a velocity 20
AND A degree of 1
and I compute my Y coordinate
THEN I get back 0

GIVEN I am a user
WHEN I enter a velocity 10
AND A degree of 45
and I compute my Y coordinate
THEN I get back 7

-- Verify Shot Hit target -- 10

Given I am user 
When i have a shot of x=5,y=5  
and target x=5, and y=5
And I compute if shot hit target
then i return true

Given I am user 
When i have a shot of x=5,y=6  
and target x=5, and y=5
And I compute if shot hit target
then i return false

Given I am user 
When i have a shot of x=6,y=5
and target x=5, and y=5
And I compute if shot hit target
then i return false

-- Shot Counter -- 10

Given i am a user
When i start the game
my shot counter is at 0

Given I am user 
When my shot counter is at 5
And I take a shot
then my shot counter is at 6

Given I am user 
When my shot counter is at 0
And I take a shot
then my shot counter is at 1

-- Randonnumber generator-- 5

No tests needed its a microsoft implemenation 

-- Target Generator -- 15

Give Iam a user
When i need a target with x=5, y=5
and i ask for target x=5,y=5
then i get x=5,y=5

Given I am a user
When i need a target with X=6 , y=5
and i ask for target x=6 , y=5
then i get x=6,y=5


Given I am a user
When i dont give any target values
and i ask for a target
then Number generator gets called 2 times

Given I am a user
When i give the target i need
and i ask for a target
then Number generator gets called 0 times


--- Game flow -- 30 mins

Given I am a user
When I start the game
then target generator called once

Given I am a user
When I start the game
then I get a the target returned by target generator

Given I am a user
When I take a shot
then angle validator is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a shot with invalid angle
then error message, "enter angle between 1 and 90" is thrown

Given I am a user
When I take a shot with invalid angle
then shot counter is not called

Given I am a user
When I take a shot
then velocity validator is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a shot with invalid velocity
then error message, "enter velocity between 1 and 20" is thrown

Given I am a user
When I take a shot with invalid velocity
then shot counter is not called

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
then shot counter is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
then X calculator counter is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
then Y calculator counter is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
then shot verifier is called once

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
and the shot verifier returns true for "is hit"
then the game is over

Given I am a user
When I take a valid shot (valid angle and velocity)
and the shot verifier returns false for "is hit"
then the game is not over
